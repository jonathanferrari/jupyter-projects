    "### Introduction\n",
    "During the pandemic, it has become glaringly obvious that COVID-19 has affected us all, for better or worse. However, it seems many Americans have vastly different opinions on the issue; covid has become a political issue. So, I decided to dig deeper into the relation, using topics from data science to build a machine learning algorithm that makes predictions based upon this information. An algorithm with a high accuracy will signal that there is a likely relation between demographics/COVID-19 statistics and political affiliation of a county."

    "### Abstract\n",
    "In this notebook, I will create a [k-NN (k-nearest neighbors)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) classifier which takes as its features information about COVID-19 in a certain county and demographic information about that county. The classifier will return a prediction for who won the 2020 Presidential election in this county. The techniques I will use in this project include, but are not limited to: **markdown, $\\LaTeX$, importing libraries and `.csv` files, table manipulation, data cleaning and filtering, defining functions, statistical distribution analysis, for loops, and basic machine learning.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* I will use first-person-plural pronouns, such as $\\text{\"we\"}$ and $\\text{\"our\"}$. In doing so, I refer only to myself and the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definitions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Classifiers](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/what-is-a-classifier/):A classifier in machine learning is an algorithm that automatically orders or categorizes data into one or more of a set of “classes.” One of the most common examples is an email classifier that scans emails to filter them by class label: Spam or Not Spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Per Capita](https://www.thebalance.com/per-capita-what-it-means-calculation-how-to-use-it-3305876): Per capita means per person. It is a Latin term that translates to \"by the head.\" It's commonly used in statistics, economics, and business to report an average per person. It tells you how a country, state, or city affects its residents."

    "### Conclusion and Discussion\n",
    "As we can see from the $92.6\\%$ accuracy of the `classify` function, given basic demographic information about a county, and its COVID-19 total case and total death count per-capita, we can conclude that it is likely that the identity of a county's residents and its reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic do correlate with their political affiliation. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible that the ability of the algorithm to predict the winner of each county was due to only the demographics, or only the COVID-19 data. A further project which created classifiers for each type of data could evaluate the accuracy of both to identify where the decision border is clarified. If both have relatively low accuracy, then the association is with both; in the case that only one is high, it can be inferred that the classifier in this project was successful largely because of that set of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another, further, application of this algorithm is evaluating the accuracy of this classifier on other Presidential Elections, for instance, any past elections, or even to future elections, such as the 2024 Presidential Election, or the 2022 Midterm Election. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear to see that while this project is limited to the scope of both sets of variables, and the 2020 Presidential Election, there are endless variations that could give even deeper insight into the nature of American politics in the context of the two-party-system."
